# Delphi-Open-SSL-Errors
This is a helper unit for Delphi XE2+ for error codes returned from 
then open ssl library.

## Work in Progress
I am building this as I go and only as needed.  

The initial version just has the Certificate Errors. 

Because this unit makes extensive use of Helpers, earlier versions of Delphi are not 
supported.  Feel free to fork and add compiler directives!
